# Chat App

This is a simple chat application built with Flutter for the frontend and Node.js with MongoDB for the backend.

## Setting Up the Backend

1. **Navigate to the `backend` directory**: Open a terminal and change the directory to the `backend` folder.

2. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies for the backend.

3. **Set up MongoDB**: Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running locally on your machine. You may need to modify the MongoDB connection URL in `backend/config/db.config.js` if you're using a different setup.

4. **Start the server**: Run `npm start` to start the backend server. By default, the server will run on port 7777.

5. **Access the API**: Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints at `http://localhost:7777`.

## Setting Up the Frontend

1. **Open Android Studio**: Open Android Studio and navigate to the `chat_app` folder.

2. **Install Flutter and Dart plugins**: Make sure you have the Flutter and Dart plugins installed in Android Studio.

3. **Open the project**: Open the `chat_app` project in Android Studio.

4. **Run the project**: Use the emulator or connect a physical device and run the Flutter project.

## Additional Notes

- **Working with the backend**: It's recommended to open the `backend` folder in a separate window or in Visual Studio Code to work on backend-related tasks independently.

- **Working with the frontend**: Android Studio is the preferred IDE for Flutter development. You can use it to build and run the Flutter project efficiently.

- **API Documentation**: You can find the documentation for the backend API in the `backend` folder.
